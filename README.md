# Let's try to analyze Wordle strategies!

This isn't code for [the game itself](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), which I have nothing to do with.

Note that running the code will require a word list (a text file with a bunch of words separated by newlines).
[You can generate one here](http://app.aspell.net/create). If you're interested in using the actual wordlist
that Wordle uses, [follow the instructions here](https://bert.org/2021/11/24/the-best-starting-word-in-wordle/)
to extract the wordlist from Wordle's JS source code (and note that Wordle uses a different list of possible
solutions and possible guesses).
